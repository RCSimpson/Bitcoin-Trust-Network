# Bitcoin-Trust-Network
Here we analyize how bitcoins move between buyers and sellers and use graph theory to extract information about the communities exchanging these bitcoins. In addition we look at motifs within the graph and analyse how those motifs develop over time by making use of the dynamic mode decomposition.

### Graph Theory

Below we see the first iterations of the network evolving. We see that we start with some intial transactions and then gradualy add interactions to the network over time mappping out economic relationships with different users temporally.
